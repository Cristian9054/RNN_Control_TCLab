# RNN_Control_TCLab
Recurrent Neural Network Control of a TCLab.

This repository contains the code used in the paper Recurrent Neural Networks Based Control of a Temperature Control Laboratory (JJAA sep 2022, update when its published).

The project encompasses two tasks. The generation and optimization of a non-linear model to use as an MPC (Model Predictive Controller). This controller is then used to generate data to train two recurrent neural networks to use as substitutes of the MPC.
